			<h2> Tracy </h2>
			<p class="big"> "Tracy" is a Hyper island project that I was a part of for the public transport company Transdev.<br> The brief was to come up with a concept/idea around the future of public transport. <br>
			From own experience and by doing user research we realised that busses often need to reject<br>
			passengers on some routes due to lack of space and on other days entertain lonely riders <br>through a unnecessarily long ride<br>
			Since we wanted to change this we came up with the solution "Tracy".<br>
			Tracy can be the possible future or side kick of public transport. <br>
			By using the passenger's behaviours and planned activities in real time, the bus will dynamically plan <br>the current routes and the bus driver will follow a GPS instead of having a fixed list of stops (as it is today). <br> The system behind Tracy is coordinating all buses and make sure that every passenger <br>get the most efficient route depending on other passengers. <br>
			<p class="big">
			It works like this: <br>
			With a few clicks, the passengers tell the bus service where they are, where they want to go and when. <br>A small 20 seat electrified bus pick them up close to their location and drive them to their <br>destination. <br>
			During the trip, people will jump on and off the bus, and new directions might be generated on the fly <br>if someone make a new request close to your route. If a new request is popping up outside your <br>route, one of Tracy's colleagues will take care of that passenger.
