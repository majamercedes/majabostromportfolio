				<h2> Redesign of App Store </h2>
				<p class="big"> This is a Hyper Island student project that I was a part of during four weeks in the course “Mobile design”. The brief was to “Redesign a part of your daily mobile experience”. 
				We looked through browsers and apps and found out that the placement and usabilty of the search function in many apps is a problem.  
				We chose to redesign App Stores search view since we saw a good potential in it. 
				<br>Based on our usability tests together with our user interviews we found out that App Stores most used navigation was search.
				With this information we started to build a user journey that helped us to point out highlights and pains in the usage of appstore. 
				<br>After doing ideation we decided to go for the idea to only have the search function in the navigation bar. We started doing simple sketches and lo-fi prototypes, using physical material and marvel. After some testing both inside and outside the team we adjusted and created wireframes. <br>When building the hi-fi prototype we followed iOS guidelines and created a more customised experience for the user with the opportunity to search for the purpose and save categories that the user likes.
