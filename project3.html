	<h2> Neatbox </h2>
	<p class="big"> 
	During  fall 2015 we got a challange from our industry leaders at the company River to explore and evaluate the mobile landscape, but also to impress and be memorable. <br> 
	We had 2 weeks to do this and we came up with the solution Neatbox.
	Neatbox is  a smart storage box, that works together with:<br> <br>1. A mobile app that will help you to know what you put in a box/ take away/what is attractive on the second hand market.<br> 2. Neural networks such as IBMs Watson that allows Neatbox to identify the things that you put in it without having you to describe them, by image recognition<br> 3. By just syncing Neatbox with the easy-to-use app via Bluetooth/ibeacons. Neatbox will automatically record its last location, also giving you the option to alert a concrete Neatbox for an easy access and identification.
	<br><br>


	The target users of neatbox are people who wants to get a better overview of what they own and what they can earn from it. By using the app the users can find where their items are located and since the app is connected to the second han market the users will also be able to know if there is interest for items like theirs.<br>
