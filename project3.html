		<h2> Neatbox </h2>
		<p class="big"> 
			Neatbox is a project I did as my admissions day task as a part of getting in to Hyper Island.<br> 
			I got in and during the fall we had our mobile landscape module with the task to design <br>something for the future mobile landscape. I wanted to develop this idea together with my <br>team and we came up with some more features. 
			<br>
			The target users of neatbox are people who want to store their stuff in an easier way.<br> 
			By using the app the users can find where their items are located and will also <br>
			be able to know if there is interest for the items on the second hand market. <br>

			<p>Role: Design, Illustrations, Development, research, UX, UI<br></p>

            <p>Tools: Illustrator, Photoshop, Agile-working, LOFi/HiFi prototype, Brainstorming, QR-tags,<br> Possible future of IBeacon stickers that can talk to each other.</p>
