		<h2> Bumpaphone </h2>
		<p class="big">

			<p>I often find it hard to handle business cards. Most of them look similar and it's easy to loose them and <br>forget what I needed a persons business card for. <br>  
			Bumpaphone is a business card in the form of an app with more possibilites to pick specific stuff that <br>you want to share with different contacts.<br> </p>

			<p>It works like this: <br> 
			1. The user choose what he/she wants to share in the profile. This can be different for different contacts. <br> 
			2. The user hold its phone close to the person that he/she wants to share business card with and the <br>information transfers over to the others app. <br>
			3. To remember when the persons met or why they have each others business cards it's possible to <br> either record a voice message or write a note about it.</p>
