			<h2> Pushed away </h2>
			<p class="big"> Pushed away is a project I did during six weeks in our web development course at Hyper island. <br>
				The brief was to visualize a solution regarding the world crisis and my team chose to
				tackle the situation of refugees by using web code and tell a story about the journey that refugees are going through when they leave their countries to find safety. <br></p>

			<p class="big">	The process started off with ideation and Lo-Fi protoype on paper and when we felt that everyone where on board we started to build the MVP/Hi-Fi with HTML and CSS to discover parts to be clear out before getting to the finished product.
				To collabroate in the team and share our code we used GitHub.<br>

The response of the site was very positive and voted as the best solution in the class.<br>	</p>
